LL(1) parsing is a technique used to construct efficient parsers for context-free grammars. It is a top-down parsing method that uses a lookahead of one symbol to make parsing decisions. This approach is particularly useful for LL(1) grammars, which are a subset of context-free grammars with certain restrictions on their productions. This paper presents a detailed explanation of LL(1) parsing and its construction of the parsing table. It discusses the algorithms to compute the First and Follow sets and describes the process of filling the parsing table.
